Bombe 0.3.2
===========

Bombe 0.3.2 resolves a critical bug with `JarEntryRemappingTransformer` where it
would crash given a manifest with no `Main-Class`.

As Bombe 0.3.x is still in use by the latest version of Lorenz and Atlas, and
used in software running today - this is why a further release to 0.3 is being
made.
