Bombe 0.4.4
===

Bombe 0.4.4 is a small release introducing some new APIs to bolster the
capabilities of the jar transformation framework, namely allowing entries to be
introduced. To accomplish this, a `JarEntryTransformer#additions()` method has
been introduced. A release of Atlas will be made shortly to implement this
feature.

The remapping transformer will additionally strip signature files and entries
in the manifest. This transformer may in future be available standalone.
