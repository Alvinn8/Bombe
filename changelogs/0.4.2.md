Bombe 0.4.2
===========

Bombe 0.4.2 resolves an oversight when bumping to ASM 7, notably that our
`ClassProviderInheritanceProvider` was still using `ASM6` - this has now been
resolved to use `ASM7`, in addition to a new constructor to allow for
third-parties to specify which ASM API version they wish to use.

An equivalent change was made in Bombe 0.3.3.
