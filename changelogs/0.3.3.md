Bombe 0.3.3
===========

Bombe 0.3.3 resolves an oversight when bumping to ASM 7, notably that our
`ClassProviderInheritanceProvider` was still using `ASM6` - this has now been
resolved to use `ASM7`, in addition to a new constructor to allow for
third-parties to specify which ASM API version they wish to use.

*As Bombe 0.3.x is still in use by the latest version of Lorenz and Atlas, and
used in software running today - this is why a further release to 0.3 is being
made*.
