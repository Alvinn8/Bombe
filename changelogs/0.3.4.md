Bombe 0.3.4
===========

Bombe 0.3.4 resolves a regression made when splitting up the previous systems in
Bombe 0.2.x, specifically a `NullPointerException` that can occur when using
`ClassLoaderClassProvider`.

*As Bombe 0.3.x is still in use by the latest version of Lorenz and Atlas, and
used in software running today - this is why a further release to 0.3 is being
made*.
