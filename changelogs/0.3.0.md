Bombe 0.3.0
===========

Bombe 0.3.0 continues the Bombe mission, further working towards making a cleaner codebase
that can be used further afield than Lorenz or Survey.

## Changes

- The `bombe-core` module has been renamed to simply `bombe`, becoming more inline with the
  Lorenz modules.
- `Type#isInstanceof` has been renamed to `Type#isAssignableFrom`.
