Bombe 0.3.5
===

Bombe 0.3.5 is a small release introducing some new APIs to bolster the
capabilities of the jar transformation framework, namely allowing entries to be
introduced. To accomplish this, a `JarEntryTransformer#additions()` method has
been introduced. The `Jars` utility has been updated to support this, and a
release of Atlas will be made shortly to implement this feature.

The `Jars` utility has been deprecated in this version, advising consumers to
switch to Atlas. Jars was removed in 0.4.0, so this just serves as a final
notice to any lingering applications using the utility.

The remapping transformer will additionally strip signature files and entries
in the manifest. This transformer may in future be available standalone.
